// Audit CI mode: a baseline of accepted findings and the diff against it.
//
// An audit a team runs once decays into a report nobody reads; the version a
// team KEEPS running is the one wired into CI, and CI has exactly one lever —
// the exit code. So the contract is narrow: --baseline writes the accepted
// state to a committed file, --ci exits non-zero ONLY on findings that file
// has never seen. Accepted debt stays visible in the baseline; the build goes
// red only when someone adds to it, which is the Tuesday morning the drift
// actually landed.
//
// Everything here hangs off the finding KEY. It must be stable across runs
// (a sampled id changing between probes must not read as new drift) yet
// discriminating enough that a second schema break on an already-flagged
// operation still goes red — so the key includes the detail with every
// parenthesised aside (sampled ids, live status codes) blanked out.
