// CONNECT — the wiring, as one command.
//
// The measured fact this exists for: a frontier agent does NOT pick this tool up
// on its own mid-task (F6c), but it honours a convention that a human wired in.
// So adoption is a HUMAN act, and every step of that act is a place a tester
// gets it wrong and concludes the product is broken. A hand-edited .mcp.json
// with a relative path silently never launches; a skill installed under the
// wrong directory name silently never loads; a per-host credential that lives
// only in the tester's shell is simply absent when the host spawns the server.
// Each of those reads as "the tool does not work" and none of them is a bug we
// would ever see. This module removes the hand edit.
//
// Three rules it does not bend:
//   MERGE, NEVER CLOBBER. The config belongs to the user; we own one key in it.
//     Anything we did not write and cannot recognise is a reported conflict with
//     the exact entry printed, not an overwrite.
//   PLAN, THEN WRITE. Every decision is computed as a plan (pure, testable, and
//     what --dry-run prints); the writing is a separate, dumb step. A dry run
//     that took a different code path would be a preview of a different command.
//   INSIDE THE PROJECT ONLY. Global agent config (~/.codex, ~/.claude.json) is
//     the user's machine, not their repo. Claude Code and Codex both have
//     project-scoped config, so those are the two unconditional targets.
//
// Pure functions here, I/O at the edges, so the CLI stays a thin caller.

// --- the registration entry -------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The MCP server entry a host launches.
 *
 * npm installs use an immutable package invocation, independent of npm's cache
 * location. Source checkouts use an absolute server path and a stable Node
 * alias where available. Project/config paths remain machine-local: teammates
 * run `connect` after a clone instead of committing another machine's paths.
 *
 * API_CONFIG is the multi-credential half. The client routes per-host auth by
 * the request's origin off `hosts` in api-environments.json, so pinning the
 * config path is what makes ONE registration serve every declared host instead
 * of only the default base URL. Omitted when there is no config file, because
 * pointing API_CONFIG at a file that does not exist is a hard CONFIG_NOT_FOUND
 * on every call — strictly worse than the env-var fallback path.
 *
 * API_EVIDENCE is the SAME pin, and it was the one this originally missed.
 * `evidenceDir` defaults to "./evidence" and the client resolves it with no
 * base, i.e. against process.cwd() — the HOST's cwd. Every tools/call creates
 * that directory, so with the host spawned somewhere unwritable every call died
 * "ENOENT: mkdir '/evidence'" (reported to the agent as a transport failure, so
 * the tester blames their own API server), and with the host spawned somewhere
 * writable the call succeeded while depositing response bodies outside the
 * project, where the evidence id in the reply names a file the human cannot
 * find and `receipt`/`show` in the repo never see it. Pinning it absolute is
 * the fix that works everywhere; a `cwd` field on the entry is not, because it
 * is not part of the config shape every host reads, and a host that ignores it
 * would fail in exactly the silent way this exists to remove.
