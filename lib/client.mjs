// risk is one level up — two subagents issuing the same create, or an agent
// retrying after its own timeout. Two defences:
//
//   1. Send an Idempotency-Key on non-idempotent methods so a server that
//      supports them can collapse the duplicate authoritatively.
//   2. Coalesce identical in-flight requests locally, which works even against
