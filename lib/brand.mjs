// THE NAME — one constant, everything else derived.
//
// Read this file first if you are renaming the product. The procedure is four
// steps and they are all below; everything else in lib/ and bin/ derives.
//
// The name is Sannr (chosen 2026-08-19); it arrived through this seam, and
// the seam stays, because a name that moved once can move again — and because
// spraying a name through 8,000 lines is how you pay later: a grep-and-replace
// across code, help text, on-disk filenames, delimiters in files we already
// wrote into a user's repo, and an MCP server key an agent addresses by string
// is exactly the change that breaks three of those and passes the tests anyway.
//
// So the rename is ONE EDIT: change PRODUCT below. Every user-visible mention,
// every derived filename, and every delimiter follows. test/connect.test.mjs
// pins that claim by renaming the product through the seam and asserting no
// command still prints the old name — the guarantee is checked, not promised.
//
//   RENAMING, IN FULL
//   1. edit PRODUCT here                      → all code, help, output, filenames
//   2. `sed -i '' s/sannr/newname/g` the PROSE_SURFACES listed below
//      (markdown assets and docs, which are prose and not derivable). One of
//      them is load-bearing beyond prose: skill/write-context/SKILL.md declares
//      `name: sannr-write` in its front matter, and Claude Code keys a
//      skill by the DIRECTORY it is installed under, which connect takes from
//      that declaration. Miss it and the rename leaves an old-name directory in
//      every user's repo.
//   3. package.json `name` (the scoped `@newname/newname`, see NPM_PACKAGE)
//      and its `bin` keys                     → the npm identity
//   4. `npm run test:full`                    → the rename test fails loudly if
//                                               step 1 was not actually enough,
//                                               and the inventory test fails if
//                                               PROSE_SURFACES has gone stale
//
// Nothing else in lib/ or bin/ may hardcode the name. That is the whole point,
// and three tests enforce it: a rename through the seam that no command's
// output may survive, an inventory check on PROSE_SURFACES in both directions,
// and a source check that forbids re-spelling a constant declared here.

 * checkout has a third honest form: the Node script that is running this CLI.
 * After
 * `npm install --save-dev`, `sannr doctor` is command-not-found, and
 * every "Run: …" line we print is then a small lie told to someone who
 * installed the tool CORRECTLY — including the pointer block committed into
 * their CLAUDE.md, where a teammate reads it weeks later with no way to know
 * which install the author used. That is the difference between a tool that
 * feels finished and one that feels like a prototype, and it costs one string.
 *
 * The discriminator is layout, not guesswork: npm puts a local dependency at
 * <project>/node_modules/<name>/ with a shim at <project>/node_modules/.bin/,
 * so if that shim exists next to us, it is the runnable form. A GLOBAL install
 * also sits under a node_modules, which is why the shim is what is checked
 * rather than the path shape — the global one is on PATH and the bare name is
 * right there.
 *
 * A bare checkout is invoked with `node bin/cli.mjs`; when that script is the
 * process entrypoint, preserve its actual path instead of inventing a bare command.
 * This is intentionally limited to the CLI entrypoint: importing the
 * brand seam from a library or test must not turn every example into a path to
 * the test runner.
 *
 * Resolved once, at load: an install does not change under a running process,
 * and a per-call check would make every string a function.
