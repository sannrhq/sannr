// Every other suite runs the CLI out of the repo, where `files` in package.json
// is inert and every file is present because it is checked in. That is exactly
// the blind spot: the `files` array is the only thing standing between "works
// on my machine" and a tester's `npm install` producing a package with a
// missing piece — and the pieces that go missing are the ones no import
// statement mentions, so no linter, type-checker or unit test can catch it.
// `skill/` was one: it was not in `files`, so an installed copy shipped no
// skills, `connect` installed nothing, the write convention never reached the
// agent, and NOTHING ACCUMULATED. The tool would have looked like it worked.
//
// So this suite refuses to trust the repo. It packs the package the way npm
// does, extracts the tarball somewhere with no repo anywhere above it, and
// RUNS things out of the extracted copy: the CLI, and the MCP server over
// JSON-RPC. What it asserts is behaviour from that copy, never the shape of a
// file list, because a file list is a claim and a running binary is evidence.
